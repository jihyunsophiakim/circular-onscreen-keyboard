# circular-onscreen-keyboard
The on-screen keyboard that comes with Windows is basically regular QWERTY keyboard (which is designed for use with ten fingers!) recreated on screen. I wanted to create an on-screen keyboard that is easier to use. By definition, every point in a circle is equidistant from the center, so a with keys arranged into circles, the distant that the cursor needs to travel to reach each key would vary less.
